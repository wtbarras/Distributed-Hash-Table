The makefile will compile everything for you with the 'make' command
  Other targets are 'clean' and 'package'

The MessageNode and the Registry run from the command line with the arguements
specified in the assignment

The MessageNodes will register themselves as soon as they are started, so they
need to be started after the Registry

As the MessageNodes register, the information from their registration message
will be displayed, as well as the number of nodes that have been added so far
  This step sometimes hangs a little. There can be 5-7 seconds between registrations

After all the nodes are registered, the setup-overlay command can be given.
If you don't specify an argument from that command, the prompt will sit there
until it is given another token to read.
When this command has finished, it will alert you that you can send the task
initiate message.

The start command has the same behavior as the setup-overlay command, in that
you must specify an argument for it to do anything.

You will be alerted as the registry receives messages from nodes saying they're done.
After all have completed, then the program waits for 20 seconds, and then prints
out the final summary of all the traffic information.
